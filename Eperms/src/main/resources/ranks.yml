# ExcrelePerms Configuration
# This file defines ranks, permissions, and player assignments for the ExcrelePerms plugin.
# Ranks are categorized into Player Ranks, Donation Ranks, Staff Ranks, and Creator Ranks for clarity.
# Each rank includes permissions, inheritance, and display information (prefix).
# Use permission nodes like 'essentials.*' for plugins like EssentialsX, or negate permissions with a leading '-'.
# Progression tracks define the order for promoting/demoting players.
